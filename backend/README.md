# Backend Server

This directory is intended for the Node.js/Express backend server.

The server will be responsible for:
- Handling API requests from the frontend.
- Authenticating users (admins, drivers).
- Interacting with the Prisma client to perform database operations.
- Real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets) for live tracking in future versions.

#  Introduction {#introduction}

#  Overview {#overview}

Urban transport is the backbone of Ethiopia's rapidly growing cities. As
Addis Ababa's population exceeds five million, efficient and reliable
public transportation has become essential for daily mobility. Public
buses operated by the Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise (ACBSE),
Sheger Mass Transit, and various private associations serve as the
primary mode of transport for most residents. However, these services
face persistent operational and communication challenges that hinder
effectiveness and passenger satisfaction.

Major issues include unreliable schedules, overcrowding, lack of
real-time information, and limited incident reporting mechanisms.
Passengers often experience long waiting times, uncertainty about bus
arrivals, and poor service coordination. At the same time, transport
authorities and associations struggle with inefficient route management,
data inaccuracy, and limited visibility into daily operations.

To address these issues, the proposed Public Bus Tracking and Scheduling
System for Ethiopian Cities aims to create a web-based platform that
improves coordination between transport administrators, drivers, and
passengers. The system's goal is to modernize public transport
management by providing accurate scheduling, route updates, and
accessible passenger information through a unified platform.

The platform will feature three main dashboards:

I.  **Admin Dashboard:** For transport authorities and associations to
    manage buses, routes, and schedules, and to monitor performance.

II. **Driver/Supervisor Dashboard:** For updating trip information,
    reporting incidents, and coordinating with administrators.

III. **Passenger Dashboard:** For viewing routes, schedules, live bus
     updates, and submitting feedback.

     The system will be built using modern web technologies that ensure
     scalability, responsiveness, and ease of maintenance. It will adopt
     a modular web architecture, connecting a central database with
     interactive dashboards and an integrated mapping interface for
     route visualization.

This chapter introduces the project by presenting the background of the
transport sector, the problems identified in the current system, and the
objectives of the proposed solution. It also outlines the project's
significance, key beneficiaries, scope, methodology, feasibility,
potential risks, and development schedule. The ultimate goal is to
demonstrate how digital solutions can enhance efficiency, transparency,
and user experience in Ethiopia's urban public transport systems.

#  Background of the Organization {#background-of-the-organization}

Efficient public transportation in Ethiopian cities, especially in Addis
Ababa, is crucial for mobility, economic growth, and reducing
congestion. However, the system still relies heavily on manual
operations for bus tracking, scheduling, and reporting. Understanding
how the main transport institutions currently function and the digital
limitations they face helps identify where a *Public Bus Tracking and
Scheduling System* can make the greatest impact.

This section examines the main actors in Addis Ababa's public transport
system: the Addis Ababa Road and Transport Bureau (AARTB), Anbessa City
Bus Service Enterprise (ACBSE), Sheger Mass Transit Enterprise (SMTE),
and private operators such as Velocity Bus. Each plays a role in
managing or operating city buses, yet all share similar challenges
related to data management, system integration, and service monitoring.

##  Addis Ababa Road & Transport Bureau (AARTB) {#addis-ababa-road-transport-bureau-aartb}

The Addis Ababa Road and Transport Bureau (AARTB) is the city's
regulatory and administrative authority responsible for managing all
transport operations and setting urban mobility policies. It licenses
bus operators, approves routes, and ensures compliance with safety and
performance standards.

**Existing Systems:**

- The Bureau uses limited digital tools for permit management and fleet
  > registration, but there is no centralized or automated bus tracking
  > and scheduling system.

- Most monitoring is done manually through field inspections and reports
  > from bus enterprises.

  **Challenges:**

- **Fragmented data** --- separate systems for different operators
  > (Anbessa, Sheger, private buses).

- **Manual record-keeping** that slows data collection and reporting.

- **No real-time visibility** of bus movements or schedule adherence.

- **Delayed decision-making** during traffic disruptions or breakdowns.

##  Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise (ACBSE) {#anbessa-city-bus-service-enterprise-acbse}

Founded in 1945, Anbessa is the oldest and largest government-owned bus
operator in Ethiopia. It serves over 1.5 million passengers daily with a
fleet of more than 600 buses operating on 125+ routes across Addis
Ababa.

**Existing Systems:**

- Anbessa has partially digitized fare collection and fleet maintenance
  > logs, but bus tracking and scheduling are still manual.

- A limited GPS trial system was introduced in a few buses around 2018
  > in collaboration with the Ministry of Innovation and Technology, but
  > it was not scaled city-wide due to technical and financial
  > constraints.

**Challenges:**

- **Fixed route scheduling:** Buses per route remain constant despite
  > changing demand.

- **Manual incident reporting:** Drivers use phone calls or written
  > reports to log delays or breakdowns.

- **Aging fleet:** Frequent mechanical failures cause irregular services
  > and unreliable schedules.

- **Lack of real-time passenger information:** Passengers wait long at
  > terminals without knowing bus arrival times.

##  Sheger Mass Transit Enterprise (SMTE) {#sheger-mass-transit-enterprise-smte}

The Sheger Mass Transit Enterprise, launched in 2020, was created to
modernize public transport and complement Anbessa by serving high-demand
routes using new diesel and electric buses.

**Existing Systems:**

- Sheger has a **small-scale GPS tracking pilot** for monitoring a few
  > buses introduced in 2023.

- The data is **not integrated** with AARTB or Anbessa platforms,
  > limiting inter-agency coordination.

**Challenges:**

- **Limited fleet size** relative to passenger demand.

- **Non-integrated scheduling:** No shared system with other public or
  > private operators.

- **Manual data reporting:** Schedule and performance reports are
  > compiled at the end of the day or week, making real-time adjustment
  > impossible.

## 1.2.4 Private Bus Operators ( Velocity Bus) {#private-bus-operators-velocity-bus .unnumbered}

Private operators, including Velocity Bus under the Belayneh Kindie
Group, contribute significantly to public mobility. In 2024, Velocity
introduced over 100 Golden Dragon electric buses, making it the largest
electric fleet in East Africa.

**Existing Systems:**

- Velocity uses basic GPS-based fleet management for maintenance and
  > internal route monitoring.

- However, it operates independently, with no data integration or
  > scheduling coordination with government operators.

**Challenges:**

- **Lack of shared data platform** between private and public systems.

- **Insufficient charging infrastructure** causing operational delays.

- **Absence of centralized passenger information systems.**

# Statement of the Problem

The public bus system in Addis Ababa faces multiple operational,
informational, and systemic challenges that affect passengers, drivers,
administrators, and the city as a whole. Despite serving millions of
daily commuters, the current transport network struggles with
inefficiencies that reduce service reliability, passenger satisfaction,
and overall urban mobility. These challenges can be grouped according to
the primary stakeholders involved.

## Passenger Challenges

Passengers frequently experience uncertainty and inconvenience due to
the following issues:

- **Unpredictable arrivals:** Buses often arrive irregularly, causing
  passengers to wait more than 30 and 60 minutes without reliable
  information.

- **Overcrowding:** During peak hours (7--9 AM and 5--7 PM), buses
  become overloaded, leaving many commuters unable to board.

- **Lack of information:** There is no centralized platform providing
  accurate details on routes, schedules, or delays.

- **No feedback system:** Passengers cannot formally report complaints,
  service quality issues, or suggestions for improvement.

##  Driver and Supervisor Challenges {#driver-and-supervisor-challenges}

Bus operators and supervisors also face obstacles that limit operational
efficiency:

- **Manual incident reporting:** Drivers rely on phone calls or paper
  logs to report delays, accidents, or mechanical issues, delaying
  corrective actions.

- **No digital tools:** Mobile-friendly dashboards or platforms for
  updating stop information are not available to drivers.

- **Accountability gaps:** Supervisors have limited ability to verify
  whether buses are adhering to schedules or planned routes.

## Administrative Challenges

At the organizational level, bus associations and regulatory authorities
encounter the following problems:

- **Fragmented data:** Information on buses, routes, and schedules is
  stored in separate, disconnected systems.

- **Fixed allocation of buses:** Operators such as ACBSE assign a
  constant number of buses per route without considering daily demand
  variations.

- **Lack of analytics:** Authorities cannot access real-time data to
  optimize routes, predict delays, or respond efficiently to incidents.

- **Limited oversight:** The Bureau cannot monitor the performance of
  different operators or track service quality in real time.

## City-Level Challenges

The inefficiencies of the public bus system have broader implications
for the city:

- **Traffic congestion:** Poorly coordinated scheduling contributes to
  urban traffic jams.

- **Economic cost:** Delays and inefficiencies reduce productivity and
  increase fuel consumption.

- **Public dissatisfaction:** Weak transport services undermine public
  trust in city infrastructure and government-managed systems.

# Business Area Analysis and Requirement Definition

# Overview {#overview-1}

This chapter looks into the current operations of Addis Ababa\'s public
bus transport system and identifies specific requirements for the
proposed tracking and scheduling platform. The analysis focuses on
understanding how transport authorities, bus operators, drivers, and
passengers currently interact within the existing system while
documenting the actual workflows, communication patterns, and
administrative processes that describe daily operations.

The chapter begins with a business area analysis that lists out the main
activities performed by different stakeholders in the transport network.
Then it evaluates the limitations of current practices using the PIECES
framework, which provides a structured way to assess performance,
information flow, economic efficiency, control mechanisms, operational
effectiveness, and service quality issues. Following this, the chapter
documents the existing forms, reports, and paper-based tools that
administrators and drivers use for record-keeping and communication.
Lastly, it identifies all essential players in the system and their
specific roles, responsibilities, and challenges.

By analyzing these aspects, this chapter provides a clear understanding
of what needs to change and why. This directly informs the functional
and non-functional requirements that will guide system design and
development in the following chapters.

# Business area analysis

The business area analysis maps the current operational structure of the
public bus ecosystem in Addis Ababa. It identifies key stakeholders and
their interdependent functions, covering regulatory oversight,
operational execution, and end-user interaction. Analyzing these
existing activities is crucial for identifying pain points and defining
the requirements for a new, more efficient system design.

##  **Activities / functions of the organization** {#activities-functions-of-the-organization}

The public bus ecosystem in Addis Ababa is formed by multiple
institutions with distinct but related responsibilities:

A.  **Regulatory and Administrative Bodies**

<!-- -->

I.  **Addis Ababa Road & Transport Bureau --- AARTB**

- **Route Planning and Approval:** Determining which routes are needed
  based on population distribution and traffic patterns, then assigning
  routes to different operators.

- **Licensing and Registration:** Processing applications for new bus
  operators, issuing operating permits, and maintaining records of all
  licensed vehicles and drivers.

- **Performance Monitoring:** Conducting periodic inspections at
  terminals and along routes to verify that operators are following
  approved schedules and maintaining service standards.

- **Policy Development:** Creating regulations for fare structures,
  safety requirements, and service quality benchmarks that all operators
  must follow.

- **Data Compilation:** Collecting monthly and quarterly reports from
  operators about fleet performance, passenger volumes, and operational
  challenges.

B.  **Bus Operating Enterprises and Associations**

<!-- -->

I.  **Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise (ACBSE)**

As the largest government-owned operator, Anbessa manages a fleet of
over 400 buses serving 100+ routes. Its daily activities include:

- **Fleet Management:** Assigning buses to specific routes each morning
  based on the bus availability and maintenance schedules.

- **Driver Scheduling:** Creating shift rotations for drivers, ensuring
  each route has adequate coverage throughout operating hours.

- **Maintenance Coordination:** Tracking bus condition, scheduling
  repairs, and managing spare parts inventory.

- **Fare Collection:** Recording daily revenue from conductors who
  manually count tickets sold and cash collected.

- **Incident Documentation:** Receiving phone calls or written reports
  from drivers about accidents, breakdowns, or major delays, then
  logging these events in paper registers.

- **Terminal Supervision:** Stationing supervisors at major terminals to
  manage bus departures, handle passenger complaints, and coordinate
  with drivers.

II. **Sheger Mass Transit Enterprise (SMTE)**

Launched in 2020, Sheger focuses on high-capacity routes with newer
vehicles. Its operations mirror those of Anbessa but on a smaller scale:

- **Route Operations:** Managing assigned routes primarily on major
  corridors.

- **Limited Digital Monitoring:** Using a small GPS pilot program on
  select vehicles, though this data is not shared with other operators
  or the Bureau.

- **Performance Reporting:** Submitting weekly summaries to AARTB about
  service delivery and any operational disruptions.

III. **Private Operators (Velocity Bus )**

Private operators like Velocity Bus contribute additional capacity,
particularly on routes where government fleets cannot meet demand. Their
activities include:

- **Independent Scheduling:** Creating their own timetables without
  formal coordination with government operators.

- **Basic Fleet Tracking:** Using simple GPS devices primarily for
  internal security and maintenance purposes rather than passenger
  information.

- **Fare Management:** Operating under Bureau-approved fare structures
  but handling revenue collection independently.

C.  **Bus Drivers and Conductors**

- **Follow assigned schedules and routes**

- **Handles boarding, manage crowding, and responding to passenger
  questions** about routes and destinations

- **Manual Reporting:** Calling supervisors via personal phones when
  problems occur, such as mechanical breakdowns or severe traffic delays

- **Cash Handling:** Conductors collect fares and reconcile cash at the
  end of each shift, submitting totals to supervisors.

D.  **Passengers**

- Passengers are the end users whose daily activities shape affect
  patterns:

- Relies on personal experience, word-of-mouth information, or informal
  inquiries at terminals to determine which bus to take.

- Standing at stops without accurate information about when the next bus
  will arrive or how many passengers it might already be carrying.

- Occasionally expressing complaints directly to drivers or supervisors,
  though there is no formal system for recording or addressing these
  concerns

##  **Problems of the current system(Using the PIECES Framework)** {#problems-of-the-current-systemusing-the-pieces-framework}

The PIECES framework provides a structured approach to analyzing system
problems across six dimensions: Performance, Information, Economics,
Control, Efficiency, and Service. This analysis reveals specific
deficiencies in the current public bus transport system.

1)  **Performance Issues**

The system struggles to deliver reliable and consistent service:

- **Irregular Service Intervals:** Buses on the same route arrive
  unpredictably, sometimes with gaps of 15 minutes followed by three
  buses arriving within 5 minutes of each other. This bunching occurs
  because there is no mechanism to monitor spacing between vehicles.

- **Extended Waiting Times:** Passengers at major terminals like Meskel
  Square and Mexico Square often wait 30 to 60 minutes during off-peak
  hours and even longer during peak periods when buses bypass stops due
  to overcrowding.

- **Posted timetables at terminals frequently do not reflect actual bus
  availability.** When vehicles break down or are reassigned without
  notice, no updates reach passengers or even terminal supervisors.

- **Delayed Incident Response:** When a bus breaks down mid-route, it
  can take 45 minutes or more for a replacement to be dispatched because
  drivers must first locate a phone signal, call headquarters, and wait
  for supervisors to manually arrange alternatives.

2)  **Information Deficiencies**

Critical information gaps affect all stakeholders:

- Passengers have no way to know if their bus is approaching, delayed,
  or canceled. They depend entirely on visual observation and guesswork.

- Bus assignments, driver schedules, and maintenance records are kept in
  separate paper registers or basic spreadsheets that different
  departments maintain independently. When managers need to analyze
  patterns or make decisions, they must manually compile information
  from multiple sources.

- Route maps and stop lists vary between operators. Even within Anbessa,
  different terminals may have slightly different versions of the same
  route due to informal changes that were never officially documented.

- Without digital records, it is nearly impossible to analyze trends
  such as which routes experience the most breakdowns, which time
  periods see highest demand, or how service quality changes over
  months.

- Apart from destination signs on bus fronts, passengers receive almost
  no information about routes, schedules, or service changes. New
  residents or visitors find the system particularly difficult to
  navigate.

3)  **Economic Inefficiencies**

Current practices lead to wasted resources and lost revenue:

- **Fuel Waste from Idle Buses:** Buses often sit idling at terminals
  for extended periods because schedules are not optimized for actual
  demand patterns. Some routes are over-served during slow periods while
  others lack coverage during peak demand.

- **Inefficient Fleet Utilization:** The practice of assigning fixed
  numbers of buses to each route regardless of time of day or day of
  week means some vehicles remain underutilized while other routes
  consistently face overcrowding.

- **Manual fare collection and cash reconciliation create opportunities
  for errors and irregularities.** Without automated tracking, it is
  difficult to verify reported passenger counts against actual
  ridership.

- **Productivity Losses:** Citizens spend excessive time waiting for
  buses and dealing with unreliable service, reducing their available
  time for economic activities. This hidden cost affects the city\'s
  overall productivity.

- **Without systematic tracking of vehicle performance, preventive
  maintenance** is often neglected until major breakdowns occur, leading
  to expensive emergency repairs instead of planned upkeep.

4)  **Control Weaknesses**

The system lacks effective management and accountability mechanisms:

- **Limited Accountability:** When passengers experience poor service,
  there is no clear way to attribute responsibility. Was the driver
  late, was the bus reassigned, or was the schedule unrealistic? Without
  data, these questions cannot be answered.

- **Weak Performance Monitoring:** AARTB officials cannot systematically
  monitor whether operators are fulfilling their service obligations.
  Compliance checks rely on occasional physical inspections rather than
  continuous monitoring.

- **Difficulty Enforcing Standards:** Even when problems are identified,
  addressing them is challenging because decision-makers lack concrete
  evidence about patterns of non-compliance.

- **Informal Changes:** Drivers sometimes deviate from official routes
  based on traffic conditions or personal judgment, but these variations
  are not recorded or evaluated for potential system-wide adoption.

- **Limited Supervision Capacity:** Terminal supervisors can only
  monitor what happens directly in front of them. They have no
  visibility into whether buses are following routes correctly or
  maintaining schedules between terminals.

5)  **Efficiency Problems**

Operational processes are manual, slow, and prone to errors:

- **Manual Schedule Creation:** Administrators spend significant time
  creating weekly schedules by hand, checking paper records to avoid
  assigning the same bus to multiple routes at the same time. This
  process is tedious and still results in conflicts.

- **Slow Communication:** Drivers must physically return to terminals or
  make phone calls to report issues, creating delays in response times.
  Critical information often gets lost in translation when passed
  through multiple people.

- **Redundant Data Entry:** The same information about buses, drivers,
  and routes is recorded in multiple locations by different people,
  leading to inconsistencies and duplication of effort.

- **Time-Consuming Reports:** Compiling monthly reports for AARTB
  requires administrators to manually aggregate data from various
  sources, a process that can take several days.

6)  **Service Quality Shortcomings**

Passengers experience frustration and dissatisfaction due to:

- **Uncertainty and Stress:** Not knowing when a bus will arrive creates
  anxiety and makes going to places difficult, particularly for
  passengers trying to reach appointments or work on time.

- **Overcrowding:** During peak hours, passengers are regularly packed
  into buses beyond comfortable capacity. Many are left behind at stops
  because vehicles are too full to accept additional riders.

- **Lack of Accessibility:** There is no system to help passengers with
  disabilities, tourists, or those unfamiliar with the city identify
  which bus to take or when it will arrive.

- **No Feedback Mechanism:** Passengers who want to complain about
  service or suggest improvements have no formal channel to do so.
  Complaints made verbally to drivers or supervisors are rarely
  documented or acted upon

##  **Forms and Reports of the Current System** {#forms-and-reports-of-the-current-system}

The system must be designed to ingest, digitize, and replace the main
forms and reports currently used (examples below come from field notes
and document review). Where possible the new system should use
structured digital equivalents so data can be analysed automatically.

A.  **Forms Used in Daily Operations**

<!-- -->

I.  **Bus Assignment Sheet**

This form is prepared each morning by fleet supervisors and distributed
to drivers. It contains:

- Bus registration number (plate number)

- Driver name and license number

- Assigned route (e.g., \"Meskel Square to Gotera via Sidist Kilo\")

- Scheduled departure times from origin terminal

- Conductor name (if applicable)

- Fuel level at start of shift

Drivers carry this form throughout the day and return it at the end of
their shift. Any handwritten notes about problems encountered are added
to the margin.

II. **Driver Logbook**

Each bus maintains a logbook that stays with the vehicle. Drivers
record:

- Date and shift time

- Starting and ending odometer readings

- Number of trips completed

- Any mechanical issues observed (e.g., \"brake noise,\" \"engine
  overheating\")

- Unusual incidents (accidents, police stops)

This logbook is reviewed periodically by maintenance staff to identify
vehicles needing service.

III. **Incident Report Form**

When a significant incident occurs (breakdown, accident, major delay),
drivers or supervisors complete a detailed report containing:

- Date, time, and location of incident

- Bus registration number and driver name

- Description of what happened

- Whether police were involved

- Immediate actions taken

- Supervisor signature

These forms are submitted to the operations manager and filed for
reference.

IV. **Maintenance Request Form**

When a driver identifies a mechanical problem, they fill out a
maintenance request describing:

- Bus number

- Nature of the problem

- Severity (urgent/routine)

- Date reported

The maintenance department uses these forms to prioritize repair work
and order parts.

V.  **Fare Collection Summary Sheet**

- At the end of each day, conductors complete a summary showing:

- Route operated

- Number of passengers carried (estimated based on tickets sold)

- Total cash collected

- Tickets issued

- Discrepancies or notes

This information is used for revenue accounting and ridership estimates.

B.  **Reports Generated Periodically**

<!-- -->

I.  **Daily Operations Report**

- Operations managers compile a summary each evening covering:

- Total number of buses dispatched by route

- Number of trips completed

- Buses that did not operate (with reasons: maintenance, no driver,
  etc.)

- Major incidents or delays

- Passenger complaints received verbally

This report is reviewed by senior management to identify immediate
issues.

II. **Weekly Fleet Status Report**

The maintenance department produces a weekly summary showing:

- Total buses in fleet

- Buses currently operational

- Buses under repair (with expected return dates)

- Buses awaiting parts

- Maintenance costs incurred

This helps administrators understand fleet availability and budget for
repairs.

III. **Monthly Performance Report to AARTB**

Each operator submits a monthly report to the Bureau containing:

- Total passengers carried (estimated)

- Total kilometers traveled

- Number of buses operated

- Summary of major incidents or breakdowns

- Service disruptions and causes

- Revenue collected

AARTB uses these reports to monitor operator performance and compliance
with license terms. The proposed system must provide electronic versions
of these forms plus exportable reports (CSV/PDF) and dashboards for
quick oversight.

C.  **Limitations of Current Forms and Reports**

These documents present several challenges:

- **Creating reports requires staff to manually review hundreds of paper
  forms,** making the process slow and error-prone.

- **Data Loss:** Paper forms can be lost, damaged, or incompletely
  filled out, resulting in gaps in records.

- **No Standardization:** Different terminals or departments may use
  slightly different versions of forms, making aggregation difficult.

- **Delayed Insights:** By the time reports are compiled and reviewed,
  the information is often days or weeks old, limiting its usefulness
  for operational decisions.

- **Difficult Analysis:** Identifying patterns or trends requires
  tedious manual review of past reports, which is rarely done
  systematically.

- **Storage Challenges:** Boxes of paper records accumulate over time,
  taking up space and making historical data retrieval impractical.

##  **Players of the Existing System** {#players-of-the-existing-system}

The public bus transport system involves multiple stakeholders, each
with distinct roles, responsibilities, and interactions with other
players. Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing a
system that serves everyone effectively.

A.  **Regulatory and Administrative Bodies**

<!-- -->

I.  **Addis Ababa Road and Transport Bureau (AARTB)**

The Bureau acts as the central regulatory authority with the following
responsibilities:

- Issues operating licenses to bus companies and associations

- Approves route assignments and fare structures

- Sets safety and service quality standards

- Monitors operator compliance through inspections and reports

- Mediates disputes between operators or between operators and
  passengers

- Coordinates with city planning authorities on transport infrastructure
  development Bureau officials interact with operators through formal
  meetings, written directives, and periodic compliance checks.

II. **Transport and Logistics Agency (Federal Level)**

While AARTB manages city-level operations, the federal Transport and
Logistics Agency provides:

- National policy guidance on public transport

- Standards for vehicle registration and driver licensing

- Coordination between regional transport authorities

Federal agencies have limited direct involvement in day-to-day bus
operations but influence long-term planning and regulatory frameworks.

B.  **Bus Operating Enterprises and Associations**

<!-- -->

I.  **Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise (ACBSE)**

As the primary government-owned operator, Anbessa employs:

- General Manager: manages overall operations, strategic planning, and
  relationships with AARTB.

- Operations Managers: Supervise daily fleet deployment, schedule
  preparation, and service delivery.

- Fleet Maintenance Manager: Coordinates vehicle repairs, parts
  procurement, and preventive maintenance programs.

- Terminal Supervisors: Manage bus departures at major terminals, handle
  immediate operational issues, and communicate with drivers.

- Administrative Staff: Process driver payroll, maintain paper records,
  and compile reports for management and AARTB.

Anbessa serves as the backbone of the system but faces challenges with
aging infrastructure and limited modernization resources.

II. **Sheger Mass Transit Enterprise (SMTE)**

Sheger operates similarly to Anbessa but with:

- Newer fleet focused on high-capacity routes

- Smaller organizational structure with fewer administrative layers

- Limited pilot GPS tracking on some vehicles (not integrated city-wide)

Sheger management coordinates with AARTB but operates independently from
Anbessa with no formal data sharing.

III. **Private Operators (Velocity Bus )**

Private operators bring additional capacity through:

- Operator Management: Company executives who negotiate route licenses
  with AARTB and manage business operations.

- Fleet Coordinators: Assign buses and drivers to routes based on demand
  and vehicle availability.

- Maintenance Contractors: Often outsource repairs to third-party
  garages rather than maintaining in-house facilities.

Private operators value operational independence but face challenges
coordinating with government systems and accessing shared infrastructure
like terminals.

C.  **Drivers and Conductors**

<!-- -->

I.  **Bus Drivers**

Drivers are the most visible face of the system to passengers. Their
responsibilities include:

- Following assigned routes and attempting to maintain schedules

- Operating vehicles safely according to traffic laws

- Managing passenger boarding and flow

- Reporting mechanical problems and incidents

- Collecting fares (on buses without conductors)

Drivers interact with terminal supervisors at the start and end of
shifts, communicate with dispatchers when problems arise, and respond to
passenger questions throughout the day. Many drivers have years of
experience and develop personal strategies for navigating traffic and
managing routes.

II. **Conductors**

On buses conductors:

- Collect fares and issue tickets

- Manage passenger flow and door operation

- Assist passengers with boarding, especially elderly or disabled riders

- Count and record revenue at shift end

Conductors provide important passenger service but their role is
decreasing as operators shift to automated fare collection systems.

D.  **Passengers**

Passengers are the end beneficiaries of the system but currently have
limited formal representation. Different passenger groups have varying
needs:

I.  **Regular Passengers**

- Workers, students, and others who use buses daily develop deep
  knowledge of routes and timing through repeated experience. They know
  which buses to take and roughly when to expect them, but still face
  uncertainty during disruptions.

II. **Occasional Passengers**

- Residents who use buses infrequently or visitors to the city struggle
  to navigate the system without clear route information or schedules.
  They often ask drivers or other passengers for help.

III. **Vulnerable Passengers**

- Elderly passengers, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and
  those with young children face particular challenges with overcrowded
  buses and lack of accessible information.

Passengers interact with the system primarily through drivers and
terminal staff, with limited formal channels for feedback or complaints.

E.  **Support and Maintenance Staff**

<!-- -->

I.  **Mechanics and Technicians**

Maintenance staff keep the fleet operational through:

- Routine servicing based on mileage or time intervals

- Responding to driver-reported problems

- Emergency roadside assistance for breakdowns

They rely on driver logbooks and maintenance request forms to prioritize
work but often lack complete vehicle history due to poor record-keeping.

II. **Terminal Staff**

Workers at major terminals include:

- Security personnel who manage vehicle and passenger movement

- Information desk staff who answer passenger questions

- Cleaners who maintain facility hygiene

Terminal staff observe daily operations but have no formal role in
service planning or improvement.

III. **Informal Players**

**Street Marshals (Lebash)**

Informal coordinators at some bus stops help direct passengers to the
correct buses and manage queuing. They are not officially employed by
operators but perform a valuable service that passengers recognize and
sometimes compensate voluntarily.

Parts Suppliers and Service Providers

Local businesses supply spare parts, fuel, tires, and other necessary
inputs. Relationships with reliable suppliers are critical for
maintaining fleet availability.

**Summary of Stakeholder Interactions**

The current system involves complex interactions among these players:

- AARTB issues directives → Operators implement services → Drivers
  execute routes → Passengers use buses

- Drivers report problems → Supervisors coordinate responses →
  Maintenance staff repair vehicles

- Operators compile reports → Submit to AARTB → Bureau monitors
  compliance

- Passengers provide informal feedback → Drivers relay concerns → Rarely
  reaches management

The lack of integrated digital systems means these interactions rely
heavily on manual communication, paper forms, and personal
relationships. Information flow is slow, often incomplete, and difficult
to verify. A digital tracking and scheduling platform could formalize
many of these interactions while maintaining the human relationships
that make the system function.

# Requirements Definition

## Functional Requirements

The Public Bus Tracking and Scheduling System for Ethiopian Cities is
designed to address the operational and service delivery gaps found in
existing public transportation management. The system must provide the
following functional capabilities to ensure seamless administration,
monitoring, and service enhancement across bus operators such as
Anbessa, Sheger, and Velocity.

- **Bus and Driver Registration:** Maintain accurate digital records of
  > buses (plate number, capacity, operator type) and drivers (license
  > number, contact information, assigned routes).

- **Route and Schedule Management:** Provide CRUD operations for routes
  > and schedules, static map visualization, and automated conflict
  > detection for overlapping time allocations.

- **Driver Dashboard:** Offer a mobile-friendly interface allowing
  > drivers to update stop progression, submit incident reports, update
  > trip information, and communicate with administrators.

- **Passenger Dashboard:** Enable passengers to search routes or
  > schedules, view static route maps, estimate arrival times based on
  > schedule, and submit service feedback.

- **Administrative Dashboard:** Present real-time summaries of buses,
  > active routes, unreported vehicles, delays, and overall fleet
  > performance indicators.

- **Analytics and Reports:** Generate daily, weekly, and monthly
  > summaries for operations planning, delay analysis, feedback trends,
  > and route performance evaluation.

- **Incident Management System:** Allow drivers to log breakdowns,
  > accidents, heavy traffic, or delays with severity levels, notifying
  > administrators instantly for immediate action.

- **Passenger Feedback Categorization:** Classify passenger complaints
  > into categories (delay, overcrowding, safety issue) and produce
  > visual summaries for administrators.

- **Terminal and Stop Management:** Register bus terminals, stops, and
  > capacity details to enhance route and passenger flow planning.

- **Integration with Mapping Services:** Provide static map-based route
  > visualization using mapping APIs with support for stop markers and
  > route outlines.

- **Audit Trail and Logging:** Record all user activities (admin
  > changes, driver updates, schedule modifications) to ensure
  > transparency and accountability.

- **Static Bus Status Tracking:** Display buses marked as \'On Route\',
  > \'Delayed\', \'Under Maintenance\', or \'Awaiting Dispatch\' without
  > live GPS tracking.

##  **Non-Functional Requirements** {#non-functional-requirements}

The system must meet specific quality standards to ensure performance,
usability, and compliance. These non-functional requirements define the
essential attributes that guarantee reliability, security, and long-term
scalability of the platform.

  > must protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

- **Performance:** All dashboards should load within 3 seconds on a 4G
  > connection; database queries must execute efficiently.

- **Maintainability:** The system must be built with modular
  > architecture (frontend, backend, database) to support updates and
  > new integrations.

- **Accessibility:** Interfaces must support mobile-friendly layouts and
  > be usable on low-bandwidth connections.

- **Portability:** The web-based system must run effectively across
  > multiple browsers and low-end smartphones.

# Object Oriented Analysis

#  Overview {#overview-2}

This chapter presents the Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) for the Public
Bus Tracking and Scheduling System for Ethiopian Cities. Object-Oriented
Analysis is a crucial methodology used to define the software
requirements by modeling the system as a group of interacting objects.
The primary goal of this phase is to identify and formally describe the
system\'s core functional requirements, business rules, and its static
and dynamic structures from the user\'s perspective.

For this project, the OOA phase is instrumental in transforming the
identified problems of urban mobility---such as unpredictable bus
arrivals, inefficient scheduling, and lack of real- time information for
passengers and managers---into a clear, structured, and unambiguous
software specification. The models developed in this chapter will serve
as the foundational blueprint, ensuring that the subsequent design and
implementation stages are aligned with the specific needs of Ethiopian
cities\' public transport ecosystem. This analysis is structured into
three key modeling activities: Use Case Modeling to capture functional
requirements, Conceptual Modeling to define the static structure, and
Sequence Diagramming to illustrate dynamic interactions.

# Use Case Modeling

Use Case Modeling is a foundational technique in object-oriented
analysis that serves to capture the functional requirements of a system
from an external perspective. It focuses on what the system should do,
rather than how it will do it, by defining the interactions between
users and the system to achieve specific, valuable goals. For the Public
Bus Tracking and Scheduling System, this process is instrumental in
translating the complex, real-world challenges of urban Ethiopian
transport---such as information asymmetry, scheduling inefficiencies,
and operational opacity---into a clear, structured set of system
behaviors. By systematically identifying user interfaces, defining
governing business rules, categorizing actors, and modeling their
interactions, use case modeling ensures the resulting platform is both
functionally robust and deeply aligned with the needs of its diverse
stakeholders, from daily commuters to city transport manages.

##  UI Identification {#ui-identification}

User Interface (UI) Identification is the process of enumerating and
defining the primary points of interaction between the actors and the
system. It moves beyond abstract functionality to conceptualize the
tangible screens and components through which users will accomplish
their goals. This step is not concerned with visual design elements like
color or typography, but rather with the functional layout, information
architecture, and navigational flow. For this system, UI identification
is critical due to the varied contexts of its users: a passenger on a
mobile device needs quick, glanceable information, while a system
administrator at a desktop requires comprehensive data management tools.
Identifying these interfaces early ensures that the system\'s
architecture supports a seamless, intuitive, and context-aware user
experience, bridging the gap between high-level use cases and the final,
deployable application.

## Business Rules Identification

The Public Bus Tracking and Scheduling System is obliged to operate
under a clearly defined set of business rules that standardize data
management and how operational decisions are enforced. The following
business rules ensure consistency, accountability, and regulatory
compliance across all participating operators (Anbessa, Sheger,
Velocity), as well as the Addis Ababa Road and Transport Bureau (AARTB).

A.  **Bus and Driver Management Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  Each bus must be uniquely registered using a valid plate number,
    > operator type, and capacity before it can be assigned to any
    > route.

2.  A driver may only be assigned to one bus at a time, and each trip
    > can only be operated by a single active driver.

3.  Driver assignments must respect licensing requirements, meaning only
    > drivers with valid and verified licenses can operate buses.

4.  Buses marked as "Under Maintenance" cannot be scheduled until
    > maintenance status is updated to "Operational."

5.  Driver shift changes must be logged and time-stamped to ensure
    > accountability and schedule traceability.

<!-- -->

B.  **Route and Scheduling Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  A bus cannot be scheduled on overlapping routes or times, ensuring
    > no double- allocation occurs.

2.  Each route must have clearly defined stops and terminals, and these
    > cannot be modified without administrative approval.

3.  Schedules must follow the valid operational hours of the assigned
    > route, as defined by operator policy.

4.  Any schedule change must be automatically logged, including the
    > administrator who performed the modification.

<!-- -->

C.  **Incident and Maintenance Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  Drivers must report incidents (breakdown, accident, delay)
    > immediately using the system's incident reporting feature.

2.  Incident severity levels determine notification priority, with
    > critical incidents triggering instant alerts to administrators.

3.  A maintenance request must be created before a bus can be moved to
    > "Under Repair" status.

4.  Completed maintenance must be verified by a maintenance supervisor
    > before the bus is returned to service.

5.  Historical incident and maintenance records must remain uneditable,
    > preserving data integrity.

<!-- -->

D.  **Passenger Information and Service Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  Passengers must be able to view schedules, routes, and static
    > arrival estimates, and these must reflect the latest approved
    > data.

2.  Passenger feedback must be categorized (delay, overcrowding, safety,
    > etc.) and assigned a status such as "Pending," "Reviewed," or
    > "Resolved."

3.  Feedback cannot be deleted, only archived or closed by authorized
    > administrators.

4.  Service information visible to passengers must remain consistent
    > across all operators, following AARTB communication standards.

<!-- -->

E.  **System Access and Control Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  User authentication is required for all administrative and
    > operational functions, including schedule editing and bus status
    > updates.

2.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be enforced, with distinct
    > permission levels for drivers, operators, and AARTB
    > administrators.

3.  Every change or update within the system must generate an entry in
    > the audit log, including date, user, and action performed.

4.  Only AARTB administrators may approve or deactivate routes, while
    > operators manage bus and driver assignments.

5.  Drivers may only update trip progress and report incidents, not
    > modify routes or schedules.

<!-- -->

F.  **Reporting and Data Rules**

<!-- -->

1.  Daily, weekly, and monthly reports must automatically compile data
    > from the system, replacing manual reporting workflows.

2.  Data used for reports must originate only from verified internal
    > sources (driver logs, assignments, incident reports).

3.  Reports submitted to AARTB must follow standard templates for
    > performance monitoring.

4.  Historical data must be retained for audit and regulatory purposes,
    > following national digital governance standards

5.  Duplicate entries (bus registration, driver ID, route ID) must be
    > prevented at the database level.

## Actor Identification

Actors are external entities such as users, operational staff, and
automated system components that interact with the Public Bus Scheduling
and Tracking System to accomplish various transportation-related tasks.
Identifying these actors is a crucial part of system analysis because it
establishes the boundaries of the system, highlights who depends on the
system's services, and clarifies how each actor contributes to the
overall operation of the bus network.

In the context of a bus scheduling and real-time tracking environment,
the system supports multiple categories of actors, each with unique
goals and responsibilities. Administrators are responsible for managing
operational data such as buses, drivers, routes, and schedules; drivers
rely on the system to perform live trip updates and incident reporting;
passengers use the system to access route information and track buses in
real time; and internal automated services ensure continuous
communication and conflict detection.

By identifying and understanding these different actors, the system can
be designed to meet operational requirements, improve transportation
efficiency, and provide a seamless experience for all users.

## Designing the Use Case Diagram

A use case represents a specific interaction between an actor and the
system that enables the achievement of a meaningful goal. In the context
of the Public Bus Scheduling and Tracking System, use cases help

describe how different users such as administrators, drivers, and
passengers interact with the system to perform essential
transportation-related tasks. These interactions include activities like
managing bus schedules, reporting incidents, tracking bus locations, and
accessing route information.

Use case diagrams serve as an effective method for capturing and
communicating the functional requirements of the system. They provide a
visual overview of how external entities depend on the system's
capabilities and how the system must respond to achieve operational
goals. By designing a comprehensive use case diagram for the Public Bus
Scheduling and Tracking System, we can clearly define system
boundaries,identify all key actors, and document the required
functionalities in a structured and easily understandable form.

# 3.5. User Interface Prototyping {#user-interface-prototyping .unnumbered}

User interface prototyping, as described by Scott Ambler, involves
creating a preliminary version of an application\'s interface to test
its design and functionality (Ambler, 2012). This process aims to ensure
a user-friendly, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing interface that
meets user needs. It allows for early issue identification, user
feedback, and iterative design improvements, before full implementation.

This section presents the visual layout and design of the system through
the UI prototype images illustrated below.

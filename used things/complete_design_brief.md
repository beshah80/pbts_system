# Complete Design Brief for PBTS System

## Design Workflow Overview

### Phase 1: Wireframing (Balsamiq)
Use `balsamiq_design_prompt.md` to create:
- 19-23 low-fidelity wireframes
- User flow diagrams
- Information architecture
- Layout structures

### Phase 2: Visual Design (Figma)
Use `figma_design_prompt.md` to create:
- High-fidelity mockups
- Design system
- Interactive prototypes
- Developer handoff specs

## Key Project Data for Design

### Real Routes (from asset/info.json)
- Route 12: Meskel Square ↔ Bole Airport
- Route 18: Mexico Square ↔ Piassa
- Route 35: Megenagna ↔ Merkato
- Route 42: CMC ↔ Kality

### Bus Operators
- **Anbessa**: Blue buses, government-owned, 600+ fleet
- **Sheger**: Green buses, modern electric/diesel
- **Velocity**: Golden buses, private electric fleet

### User Personas

#### Admin (Transport Authority)
- Age: 35-50, office-based
- Needs: Fleet oversight, schedule management, analytics
- Devices: Desktop computer, tablet

#### Driver (Bus Operator)
- Age: 25-45, mobile worker
- Needs: Trip updates, incident reporting, schedule viewing
- Devices: Smartphone (Android/iOS)

#### Passenger (Commuter)
- Age: 18-65, daily commuter
- Needs: Route planning, real-time tracking, feedback
- Devices: Smartphone, occasional desktop

### Technical Constraints
- Web-based platform (no native apps initially)
- Mobile-responsive design mandatory
- Offline capability for drivers
- Low-bandwidth optimization
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Ethiopian Context
- Amharic language support
- Ethiopian Birr (ETB) currency
- Local time zones and formats
- Cultural color preferences
- Low-resource device support
